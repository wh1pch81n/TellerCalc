Name: "Teller Calculator"

App Description:
Tired of calculators with too many buttons?  Teller Calculator is for people that
want a simple calculator that can do basic stuff like add, subtract, multiply, and
divide.

Made for my mother, who works as a bank teller.  Her number one complaint
was that there were too many buttons.  So thats when I striped away the
unnecesary buttons and made something minimal.  

If you are looking for something simple, this app may be for you.
